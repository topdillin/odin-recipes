    <p>Technically I wrote this recipe for my real job, so it's owned by them, but still mine and I'm pretty sure they won't mind me copying it here. It's not like we invented it in the first place anyway.</p>
    <p>However, this Prohibition-era cocktail was made timeless through its inclusion in bartender Harry Craddock’s 1930 publication of The Savoy Cocktail Book. Some believe the drink was named after a mobster, possibly Abe “Angel Face” Kaminsky, who was notorious for robbing Detroit speakeasies. But, like just about any drink from this era, the origins are hard to prove.</p>
