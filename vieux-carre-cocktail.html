    <p>The Vieux Carré cocktail hails from New Orleans. Said to be created in the 1930s by Walter Bergeron at the Carousel Bar inside the Hotel Monteleone, the name translates to the original title for the French Quarter, or “old square.”</p>
    <p>The drink is similar to but often overshadowed by its predecessor, the Sazerac. Both feature whiskey, herbal liqueur and New Orleans-created Peychaud’s bitters. However, a few tweaks helped this aromatic cocktail earn a dedicated following of its own.</p>
